# Movie Ticketing System

## Description
This project focused on the implementation of a Movie theater ticketing software. The software was implemented using a web interface to allow prospective users a convenient way to use the software. A requirement of the project was the need of a DBMS and is a good study into the role and work of a DBMS.

## Background
In the movie industry, making sure that customers are able to consistently purchase movie theater tickets and reserve seats of their choice ahead of arriving at a movie showing is key to customer satisfaction, happiness, and retention. In today’s world, most movie theater goers have come to expect an unspoken standard that they should be able to see shows that are currently at a theater within at least a week’s time, when those shows are playing, and the ability to reserve seats of their choice upon purchasing tickets. The lack of these features will inevitably end up driving customers away resulting in a loss of revenue for a given movie theater. This project aimed to solve this exact problem for a hypothetical movie theater chain by developing and providing a movie theater chain with the software needed to bring their customer experience to the standard level.

## Features
This project was implemented using C# and .NET on both the backend and frontend. Our DBMS of choice for this project will be Microsoft SQL Server. Additionally, this project was deployed on Azure. The project goals achieved using these tools were as follows:
This software solution should be accessible to the customers through a web browser.
Customers should be able to see the following information about movies and their showings as they work through the reservation process:
- Movie title
- Movie genre
- Seat types and available seats
- Screen type
- Theater location
- Ticket price
- Movie showtime
The ability to reserve tickets and seats will require a user to have an account.
Customers should have the ability to reserve movie tickets online through this software, and should be able to reserve seats as the tickets are purchased
The software will reserve seats for users immediately after confirming their selection
Customers should have the option to reserve food and drink choices at the time they purchase their tickets, if they so choose.
Customers should be able to create an account using the website.
Theater information, movie information, food/drink choices, and user information should all be pulled from the database.
